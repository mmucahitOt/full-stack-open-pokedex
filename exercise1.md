# Exercise 11.1

We are a team of six developers working on a TypeScript application. To work efficiently, we need a good CI/CD pipeline. The idea is that every change should be tested, reviewed, and deployed in a safe and fast way. A simple branch strategy is to keep the `main` branch stable for production and create short feature branches for new work. When a developer opens a pull request, the CI pipeline runs automatically. It checks the code with **ESLint** for linting, **Prettier** for formatting, and runs unit tests with **Jest**. This helps us find problems early before the code is merged.

After merging, the system can deploy the code to a staging environment. In staging, we can run integration tests or end-to-end tests with tools like **Cypress** or **Playwright**. If everything works correctly, the pipeline can promote the build to production. Packaging the app into a Docker image ensures the code runs the same way in all environments.

Besides GitHub Actions and Jenkins, there are other options for CI/CD. **GitLab CI/CD**, **CircleCI**, and **Travis CI** are common cloud-based choices. For a small team, cloud solutions are often better, since they are easy to use and need less maintenance. A self-hosted solution could be better if the project has strict security rules or needs to stay inside the companyâ€™s network. To decide, we must consider cost, security, and how often we plan to release.
